# nff — LLM bridge to hardware

nff is an MCP server that gives LLMs direct control over physical hardware — on the bench during development, and in the field for maintenance and diagnosis.

Connect your board over USB and Claude writes, compiles, flashes, and reads serial output autonomously. Deploy devices with the `nff-sdk-c` library and Claude can reach them remotely: capture crash state, diagnose failures, and push fixes — without physical access.

> **nff is the open-source bench CLI of the [nff platform](https://nanoforgeflow.com)** — an end-to-end, agent-driven system for developing, shipping, and operating ESP32-class firmware (bench → OTA → fleet diagnosis). This repo (`nff`) and the device library (`nff-sdk-c`) are the two **MIT-licensed** pieces that run on the engineer's laptop and hardware; the hosted backend (fleet broker, OTA orchestration, crash-analysis engine) is proprietary.

```
you: "Run the sensor init sequence and assert the calibration values over serial"
LLM: [writes firmware] → [compiles] → [flashes ESP32] → [reads serial] → returns structured output

you: "Why did the unit in the field just hard-fault?"
LLM: [captures panic over OTA] → [reads registers + backtrace] → "Stack overflow in your sensor ISR at line 47"
```

**Supported boards:** with the **PlatformIO backend** (now the default in the Python implementation) nff is board-universal — any of PlatformIO's ~1000 boards (every ESP32 variant, RP2040/Pico, STM32, classic AVR, …), with the platform toolchain auto-installed on first build. The classic **arduino-cli backend** remains available and covers ESP32 (CP210x / CH340) · ESP8266 (FTDI) · Arduino AVR (Uno, Mega, Nano, Leonardo). See [Build backends](#build-backends).

**Shipped as a single Rust binary.** The release artifact is the compiled `nff` binary built from `nff-rs/` — a self-contained executable with no Python runtime required. The Python package under `nff/nff/` remains as the reference/prototyping implementation (features are often prototyped there first, then ported to Rust at parity); both are kept in sync, version for version. The Rust port is at full feature parity (CLI commands, MCP server + OAuth proxy, the bench-loop hardening, and the `nff pi` Raspberry-Pi probe).

## What's new in v0.2.20 — the "reliable install" release

This release is about making the bench loop **survive on its own**: the previous version (`0.2.19`) worked when a human was watching, but transient toolchain hiccups would surface as hard failures — fatal for an agent driving the loop unattended. It also brings the **Rust binary to full parity** so it becomes the shipped artifact, and adds first-run onboarding so a fresh machine can actually compile.

### Reliability — corrected
- **Transient failures are now retried, not fatal.** A new classifier tells a *transient* toolchain hiccup (arduino-cli `EINVAL` / "Invalid argument", a Windows build-dir file lock, a serial port re-enumerating after auto-reset, a slow build timing out) apart from a *genuine* compile error. Transient failures retry with backoff; real compile errors still fail fast. Previously **any** of these killed `compile`/`flash` outright.
- **Cold builds no longer time out.** The compile timeout was a flat 120 s — a first-time ESP32 build routinely exceeds that and died with "Command timed out". Compile now gets 600 s, upload 180 s, and a timeout is treated as retryable rather than a hard error.
- **Upload-failure misclassification fixed.** arduino-cli prints `uploading error:` on a transient port failure; the naive classifier mistook that for a compile error and refused to retry. A strong serial/upload signal (`failed uploading`, `could not open port`, `the port is busy`) now correctly wins over the bare word `error:`.
- **Serial is resilient.** `serial_read`/`serial_write`/`reset_device` retry transient port faults, and the serial monitor no longer crashes with a raw traceback when a device is unplugged mid-stream — it reports the error cleanly.
- **Stale-library guard.** "Flash to test my fix" could silently build the *old* library. `flash` and `doctor` now warn when a local `nff-sdk-c` checkout is newer than the synced Arduino library, so you never ship stale firmware unknowingly.

### Install / onboarding — added
- **`nff init` now installs the full build toolchain** (the `esp32` core, `PubSubClient`, and the `nff` Arduino library) on first run, so a freshly-set-up machine can compile a sketch that does `#include <nff.h>` without manual `arduino-cli` steps.
- **`doctor` gained an `nff lib` check** reporting the synced library version and flagging staleness.

### New capabilities
- **`nff pi probe`** — detect a directly-connected Raspberry Pi and tell you exactly which link in the chain is missing (cable/power → IP → SSH), via ARP-OUI matching, mDNS, and a TCP/22 probe (with an optional `--sweep`). Groundwork for running nff-pentester on a Pi node.

### Rust port → the shipped binary
- The Rust implementation in `nff-rs/` reached **full feature parity** with the Python package (all of the above, plus the existing CLI/MCP/OAuth surface) and is now the release artifact. Version bumped to **0.2.20** across the Rust crate and the Python package, which stay in lockstep. The Rust port is no longer "paused".

### Quality
- New automated tests across both implementations (retry classifier, serial retry, library sync/staleness, onboarding, `pi`, init). Rust passes `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and the full `cargo test` suite, and the whole loop (compile → flash → monitor, plus the transient-retry path) was **verified on real ESP32 hardware**.

> **Upgrade note:** the on-disk library marker (`.nff_sync_meta`) gains `version`/`synced_at` fields; libraries synced by `0.2.19` will show `?` in `nff doctor` until the next `nff install-deps`/`nff init` re-syncs them. No action required.

## Two modes, one tool

### Bench development
nff closes the edit–compile–flash–debug loop. Instead of switching between your editor, terminal, and serial monitor, you stay in one conversation. The LLM iterates on firmware in response to serial output, catches exceptions, and reflashes — handling the logistics so you focus on the problem.

### Field maintenance
Once a device is deployed, nff becomes your remote window into it. When a bare-metal MCU crashes in the field there is no shell, no SSH, no process table — just a panic on a chip you cannot physically touch. nff captures the crash state (registers, stack, memory, backtrace) and routes it to a cloud AI agent that explains the failure in plain language and drives the recovery. No truck roll. No JTAG probe on-site.

This is the gap Mender, balena, and similar OTA tools cannot fill: they require a living network client running inside the firmware. nff's field mode works precisely when the firmware is dead.

---

## Build backends

nff can drive the build/flash loop through either of two toolchains, selected per-run or persisted in config. Every `compile`/`flash` path resolves the backend the same way, so the CLI and MCP tools are identical regardless of which one is active.

| Backend | Boards | Toolchain | Sketch layout |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`platformio`** (default) | board-universal — any [PlatformIO board id](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/index.html) (`esp32dev`, `esp32-s3-devkitc-1`, `pico`, `genericSTM32F103C8`, `uno`, …) | PlatformIO Core; the platform + framework + esptool **auto-install on first build** per board family | native `src/main.cpp` + a generated `platformio.ini` |
| **`arduino`** | the [Supported Boards](#supported-boards) table (FQBN) | arduino-cli + manually installed cores | `.ino` sketch folder |

**Selecting a backend** — precedence is env var → config → default (`platformio`):

```bash
# per-run override (config untouched)
NFF_BUILD_BACKEND=platformio  nff compile sketches/esp32_vitals --board esp32dev
NFF_BUILD_BACKEND=arduino     nff compile sketches/esp32_vitals --board esp32:esp32:esp32

# persist a choice (writes build.backend + build.board to ~/.nff/config.json)
nff init --backend platformio     # → no flags needed afterwards
nff init --backend arduino        # opt back into arduino-cli
```

`--board` is backend-aware: a **PlatformIO board id** under the pio backend, an **arduino-cli FQBN** under the arduino backend. With a board saved via `nff init` you can omit `--board` entirely.

> **Status:** the PlatformIO backend currently lives in the **Python implementation** (`nff/nff/`), where it is the default. The shipped Rust binary (`nff-rs/`) still builds via arduino-cli — the PlatformIO port is in progress. Cloud onboarding (`nff init` → claim a device to the fleet) also still runs on the arduino backend; `nff init --backend platformio` configures local builds and skips that step.

## AI crash diagnosis — validated

Phase-0 validation on an ESP32 confirmed that Claude can produce specific, correct diagnoses from raw panic output alone — no ELF file, no source access:

| Crash type | Panic signature | What Claude identifies |
|---|---|---|
| Null pointer write | `EXCCAUSE 0x1d` + `EXCVADDR 0x00000000` | StoreProhibited in `setup()`, stack intact |
| Stack overflow | `EXCCAUSE 0x01` + repeated PC in backtrace | Unbounded recursion, FreeRTOS canary, depth 11 |
| Watchdog timeout | IDF task-WDT log, no Guru Meditation | `loopTask` on CPU 1 never yielded, liveness failure |

Each failure class produces a different panic format, exception code, backtrace depth, and task snapshot — rich enough signal to distinguish root causes without symbol resolution. With addr2line + the build ELF wired in (next milestone), diagnoses resolve to exact source lines.

## MCP Tools

### Bench — hardware & build

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_devices()` | List all connected USB boards |
| `compile(sketch?, code?, board?)` | Compile a sketch **only** (no board/port) to verify it builds; returns JSON `{ok, fqbn, elf, image, artifacts, errors, output}` |
| `flash(sketch?, code?, board?, port?)` | Compile **and** upload a sketch to the connected board |
| `serial_read(duration_ms?, port?, baud?)` | Capture serial output for N ms |
| `serial_write(data, port?, baud?)` | Send a string to the device |
| `reset_device(port?)` | Toggle DTR to hardware-reset the board |
| `get_device_info(port?)` | Return port, board name, FQBN, baud rate |

### Simulation — Wokwi (CI without a bench)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wokwi_flash(code, board?, timeout_ms?)` | Compile and simulate a sketch via Wokwi |
| `wokwi_serial_read(code, board?, duration_ms?)` | Compile, simulate, return serial output |
| `wokwi_get_diagram(board)` | Return a minimal `diagram.json` stub to extend |

### Field — diagnosis & auth

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `repair(serial_output, build_id?, board?)` | Send serial/crash output to the diagnosis server and return a structured diagnosis |
| `authenticate(email?, password?)` | Log in to the diagnosis server (direct, or omit both for browser OAuth) |
| `complete_authentication(timeout?)` | Wait for a browser login to finish and store the tokens |
| `auth_status()` / `auth_logout()` / `auth_clear()` / `auth_reconnect(email?, password?)` | Inspect, end, force-clear, or re-establish the authenticated MCP session |

All bench tools fall back to the default device in `~/.nff/config.json` when `port` and `board` are omitted.

> **Prefer `sketch=` (a path) over `code=`.** Write the `.ino` file to disk first and pass the sketch path, rather than raw source — it keeps the build artifact lookup deterministic. Use `compile` to check a build with no board attached; use `flash` only when a port is present.

## Quickstart

Get your hardware on the LLM loop in under five minutes.

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install nff
```

Pure-Python install (requires Python ≥ 3.10) — no compiler or Rust toolchain needed. `esptool` ships as a dependency, so no separate install is needed.

### 2. Install board cores

On the **default PlatformIO backend** there is nothing to install here — PlatformIO Core is set up by `nff init`, and the platform/framework/esptool for your board auto-install on the first build. Just make sure your sketch names a PlatformIO board id (`--board esp32dev`, etc.).

Only on the **arduino backend** do you install cores manually:

```bash
# arduino backend only — install the cores you need
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
arduino-cli core install arduino:avr
arduino-cli core install esp8266:esp8266
```

> Both toolchains (`platformio` / `arduino-cli`) are auto-installed by `nff init`/`nff install-deps` for the active backend if not already present.

### 3. Plug in your board and run init

```bash
nff init
```

This single command:
- Detects your board by USB vendor/product ID
- Writes `~/.nff/config.json` and a `CLAUDE.md` in the current directory
- Registers the nff MCP server (`claude mcp add nff nff mcp`)
- Installs the `/nff` and `/wokwi-diagram` Claude Code skills globally

```
  ✓ Found: ESP32 (CP210x) on COM10
  ✓ Config written to ~/.nff/config.json
  ✓ CLAUDE.md written to ./CLAUDE.md
  ✓ Claude skills installed: /nff, /wokwi-diagram
  ✓ Registered with Claude Code CLI (claude mcp add nff nff mcp)
  ✓ Claude Desktop config updated
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
nff doctor
```

## CLI Reference

### Real hardware

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `nff init` | Detect board, write config, register MCP server |
| `nff compile <path>` | Compile a sketch to verify it builds (no board/port needed) |
| `nff flash <path>` | Compile and upload a sketch directory |
| `nff monitor` | Stream serial output (Ctrl+C to exit) |
| `nff connect` | Attach to a device, continuously analyse its logs, autonomously repair detected issues |
| `nff repair` | Send captured serial/crash output to the diagnosis server for a structured root-cause |
| `nff auth login` | Authenticate with the diagnosis server (browser OAuth or email/password) |
| `nff doctor` | Check all dependencies and configuration |
| `nff mcp` | Start the MCP server (streamable HTTP on `127.0.0.1:3000`; called automatically by Claude Code) |

```bash
nff flash sketches/sensor_init
nff flash sketches/sensor_init --board esp32dev --port COM3   # PlatformIO board id (default backend)
nff flash sketches/sensor_init --board esp32:esp32:esp32      # arduino FQBN (NFF_BUILD_BACKEND=arduino)
nff flash sketches/sensor_init --manual-reset                 # for boards without auto-reset
nff monitor --port COM10 --baud 115200
nff monitor --port COM10 --baud 115200 --timeout 15
```

### nff connect — Autonomous log analysis and repair

`nff connect` keeps a live serial connection to your device and routes each batch of output to Claude for analysis. When Claude detects an error, a hang, or a recoverable fault, it rewrites the sketch, recompiles, reflashes, and resumes monitoring — closing the repair loop without manual intervention.

```
nff connect
  ↓ streams serial from device
  ↓ Claude analyses each log window
  ↓ fault detected → sketch rewritten → nff flash → device reset
  ↓ monitoring resumes automatically
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port PORT` | auto-detect | Serial port to attach to |
| `--baud BAUD` | 115200 | Baud rate |
| `--sketch DIR` | last flashed | Sketch directory to rewrite and reflash on a fix |
| `--window MS` | 2000 | Log window passed to Claude per analysis cycle |
| `--max-cycles N` | unlimited | Stop after N repair attempts |

|---|---|
| `nff wokwi init` | Scaffold `wokwi.toml` + `diagram.json` in current directory |
| `nff flash --sim <path>` | Compile sketch and run headless Wokwi simulation |
| `nff wokwi run` | Run simulation, stream serial output to terminal |
| `nff wokwi run --gui` | Open `diagram.json` in VS Code and auto-start visual simulation |
| `nff wokwi run --serial-log FILE` | Save serial output to file |
| `nff wokwi run --timeout MS` | Set simulation timeout (default 5000 ms) |

---

## Supported Boards

**On the default PlatformIO backend, nff is board-universal.** Pass any of PlatformIO's [~1000 board ids](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/index.html) to `--board` and the matching platform toolchain (compiler + framework + uploader) installs itself on first build — there is no fixed allow-list and nothing to pre-install.

### Curated families

These are the board ids in nff's built-in catalog. The catalog only supplies sensible defaults (PlatformIO platform + Wokwi sim chip) so you can name a short board id and `nff init` can auto-detect — **boards outside it still build**, you just pass the full PlatformIO id.

| Family | PlatformIO platform | Example `--board` ids | Wokwi sim |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ESP32** | `espressif32` | `esp32dev`, `esp32-s3-devkitc-1`, `esp32-c3-devkitm-1`, `esp32-c6-devkitc-1`, `esp32-s2-saola-1` | ✅ (S2: ❌) |
| **ESP8266** | `espressif8266` | `esp01_1m`, `nodemcuv2` | ✅ |
| **RP2040 / Pico** | `raspberrypi` | `pico`, `rpipicow` | ✅ |
| **STM32** | `ststm32` | `genericSTM32F103C8`, `bluepill_f103c8`, `nucleo_f401re` | ❌ |
| **Classic AVR** | `atmelavr` | `uno`, `megaatmega2560`, `nanoatmega328`, `leonardo` | ✅ |

Need another board (Teensy, SAMD, nRF52, ESP32-P4, …)? Just give its PlatformIO id — e.g. `nff compile sketch.ino --board teensy41`. Add it to the catalog (for auto-detect + a short default) in a PR — it's [two lines of code](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-board).

### USB auto-detect

When you plug a board in, nff resolves it by USB vendor/product ID to a default board id for **both** backends, so `nff init` and `--board`-less commands "just work". A USB-serial chip (CP210x/CH340/FTDI) is shared by many boards, so this is a *default* you can override with `--board`.

| Board | Vendor ID | Product ID | FQBN (arduino) | PlatformIO board id |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ESP32 (CP210x) | 10c4 | ea60 | `esp32:esp32:esp32` | `esp32dev` |
| ESP32 (CH340) | 1a86 | 7523 | `esp32:esp32:esp32` | `esp32dev` |
| ESP8266 (FTDI) | 0403 | 6001 | `esp8266:esp8266:generic` | `esp01_1m` |
| Arduino Uno | 2341 | 0043 | `arduino:avr:uno` | `uno` |
| Arduino Mega 2560 | 2341 | 0010 | `arduino:avr:mega` | `megaatmega2560` |
| Arduino Leonardo | 2341 | 0036 | `arduino:avr:leonardo` | `leonardo` |
| Arduino Nano | 2341 | 0058 | `arduino:avr:nano` | `nanoatmega328` |

> The **arduino backend** (`NFF_BUILD_BACKEND=arduino`) is limited to the FQBN column above plus whatever cores you `arduino-cli core install`. The PlatformIO backend is the one that makes the rest of the families above available.

---

## Config File

`~/.nff/config.json`, written by `nff init` and editable by hand:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "default_device": {
    "port": "COM10",
    "board": "ESP32 (CP210x)",
    "fqbn": "esp32:esp32:esp32",
    "baud": 115200
  },
  "build": {
    "backend": "platformio",
    "board": "esp32dev"
  },
  "wokwi": {
    "api_token": "YOUR_TOKEN",
    "default_timeout_ms": 5000,
    "diagram_path": null
  }
}
```

`build.backend` selects the toolchain (`platformio` default, or `arduino`) and `build.board` holds the PlatformIO board id; the arduino backend uses `default_device.fqbn` instead. The `NFF_BUILD_BACKEND` env var overrides `build.backend` per-run. The Wokwi token can also be set via `WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN` (takes precedence over config).

---

## Claude Code Skills

nff ships two Claude Code skills **automatically installed to `~/.claude/commands/` by `nff init`**:

| Skill | When to use |
|---|---|
| `/nff` | Full pipeline reference — hardware and simulation workflows, sketch-first rules, debugging checklist |
| `/wokwi-diagram` | `diagram.json` authoring reference — component types, pin names, wiring patterns |

```
/nff
/wokwi-diagram
```

Skill files are bundled inside the package at `nff/nff/skills/` (the source of truth — edit them there) so they ship with every `pip install nff`, and are also mirrored in `.claude/commands/` for project-level use.

The Rust crate under `nff-rs/nff/` is the **shipped binary** and is at full feature parity with the Python package — every CLI command and MCP tool runs natively (no Python runtime). Build it with `cargo build --release` (binary at `nff-rs/target/release/nff`). The Python package under `nff/nff/` is the reference/prototyping implementation and is kept in sync version-for-version; when you add a feature, land it in both so the two never drift.

## Linux: Serial Port Permissions

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
# then log out and back in
```

`nff doctor` detects this and prints the fix.

## Wokwi Simulation

Get a free CI token at https://wokwi.com/dashboard/ci, then:

```bash
nff wokwi init --board esp32dev --token YOUR_TOKEN
nff flash --sim sketches/my_sketch --board esp32dev
nff wokwi run              # headless
nff wokwi run --gui        # visual simulation in VS Code
```

(Use the arduino FQBN form — `--board esp32:esp32:esp32` — when running under `NFF_BUILD_BACKEND=arduino`.)

Install the [Wokwi VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wokwi.wokwi-vscode) for the animated circuit view.

### Wokwi MCP Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wokwi_flash(code, board?, timeout_ms?)` | Compile and simulate a sketch via Wokwi |
| `wokwi_serial_read(code, board?, duration_ms?)` | Compile, simulate, return serial output |
| `wokwi_get_diagram(board)` | Return a minimal `diagram.json` stub to extend |

### diagram.json — Circuit Schematic

Always include the serial monitor wires:

```json
["esp:TX0", "$serialMonitor:RX", "", []],
["esp:RX0", "$serialMonitor:TX", "", []]
```

Common components:

```json
{ "type": "wokwi-led",        "id": "led1", "attrs": { "color": "red" } }
{ "type": "wokwi-pushbutton", "id": "btn1", "attrs": { "color": "blue" } }
{ "type": "wokwi-servo",      "id": "srv1", "attrs": { "minAngle": "-90", "maxAngle": "90" } }
{ "type": "wokwi-resistor",   "id": "r1",   "attrs": { "value": "220" } }
```

ESP32 DevKit V1 pins: `esp:D<gpio>` · `esp:GND.1` · `esp:GND.2` · `esp:3V3` · `esp:VIN` · `esp:TX0` · `esp:RX0`

Pushbutton wiring: GPIO side → `btn1:1.l`, GND side → `btn1:2.l`. Use `INPUT_PULLUP` in the sketch.

### ESP32 Servo — No Library Required

Use the built-in LEDC peripheral instead of `ESP32Servo`. Wokwi maps its full servo range to 500 µs – 2500 µs pulses.

With 50 Hz / 16-bit resolution (period = 20 000 µs):

| Angle | Pulse | Duty |
|---|---|---|
| −90° (min) | 500 µs | 1638 |
| 0° (center) | 1500 µs | 4915 |
| +90° (max) | 2500 µs | 8192 |

```cpp
ledcAttach(SERVO_PIN, 50, 16);
ledcWrite(SERVO_PIN, 4915);
```
