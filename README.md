# nff — LLM bridge to hardware

nff is an MCP server that gives LLMs direct control over physical hardware — on the bench during development, and in the field for maintenance and diagnosis.

Connect your board over USB and Claude writes, compiles, flashes, and reads serial output autonomously. Deploy devices with the `nff-sdk-c` library and Claude can reach them remotely: capture crash state, diagnose failures, and push fixes — without physical access.

> **nff is the open-source bench CLI of the [nff platform](../README.md)** — an end-to-end, agent-driven system for developing, shipping, and operating ESP32-class firmware (bench → OTA → fleet diagnosis). This repo (`nff`) and the device library (`nff-sdk-c`) are the two **MIT-licensed** pieces that run on the engineer's laptop and hardware; the hosted backend (fleet broker, OTA orchestration, crash-analysis engine) is proprietary. See the [root README](../README.md) for the full picture.

```
you: "Run the sensor init sequence and assert the calibration values over serial"
LLM: [writes firmware] → [compiles] → [flashes ESP32] → [reads serial] → returns structured output

you: "Why did the unit in the field just hard-fault?"
LLM: [captures panic over OTA] → [reads registers + backtrace] → "Stack overflow in your sensor ISR at line 47"
```

**Supported boards:** ESP32 (CP210x / CH340) · ESP8266 (FTDI) · Arduino AVR (Uno, Mega, Nano, Leonardo)  
STM32 and RP2040 support in progress — open a PR, adding a board is [two lines of code](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-board).

**Shipped as a single Rust binary.** The release artifact is the compiled `nff` binary built from `nff-rs/` — a self-contained executable with no Python runtime required. The Python package under `nff/nff/` remains as the reference/prototyping implementation (features are often prototyped there first, then ported to Rust at parity); both are kept in sync, version for version. The Rust port is at full feature parity (CLI commands, MCP server + OAuth proxy, the bench-loop hardening, and the `nff pi` Raspberry-Pi probe).

## Two modes, one tool

### Bench development
nff closes the edit–compile–flash–debug loop. Instead of switching between your editor, terminal, and serial monitor, you stay in one conversation. The LLM iterates on firmware in response to serial output, catches exceptions, and reflashes — handling the logistics so you focus on the problem.

### Field maintenance
Once a device is deployed, nff becomes your remote window into it. When a bare-metal MCU crashes in the field there is no shell, no SSH, no process table — just a panic on a chip you cannot physically touch. nff captures the crash state (registers, stack, memory, backtrace) and routes it to a cloud AI agent that explains the failure in plain language and drives the recovery. No truck roll. No JTAG probe on-site.

This is the gap Mender, balena, and similar OTA tools cannot fill: they require a living network client running inside the firmware. nff's field mode works precisely when the firmware is dead.

## AI crash diagnosis — validated

Phase-0 validation on an ESP32 confirmed that Claude can produce specific, correct diagnoses from raw panic output alone — no ELF file, no source access:

| Crash type | Panic signature | What Claude identifies |
|---|---|---|
| Null pointer write | `EXCCAUSE 0x1d` + `EXCVADDR 0x00000000` | StoreProhibited in `setup()`, stack intact |
| Stack overflow | `EXCCAUSE 0x01` + repeated PC in backtrace | Unbounded recursion, FreeRTOS canary, depth 11 |
| Watchdog timeout | IDF task-WDT log, no Guru Meditation | `loopTask` on CPU 1 never yielded, liveness failure |

Each failure class produces a different panic format, exception code, backtrace depth, and task snapshot — rich enough signal to distinguish root causes without symbol resolution. With addr2line + the build ELF wired in (next milestone), diagnoses resolve to exact source lines.

## MCP Tools

### Bench — hardware & build

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_devices()` | List all connected USB boards |
| `compile(sketch?, code?, board?)` | Compile a sketch **only** (no board/port) to verify it builds; returns JSON `{ok, fqbn, elf, image, artifacts, errors, output}` |
| `flash(sketch?, code?, board?, port?)` | Compile **and** upload a sketch to the connected board |
| `serial_read(duration_ms?, port?, baud?)` | Capture serial output for N ms |
| `serial_write(data, port?, baud?)` | Send a string to the device |
| `reset_device(port?)` | Toggle DTR to hardware-reset the board |
| `get_device_info(port?)` | Return port, board name, FQBN, baud rate |

### Simulation — Wokwi (CI without a bench)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wokwi_flash(code, board?, timeout_ms?)` | Compile and simulate a sketch via Wokwi |
| `wokwi_serial_read(code, board?, duration_ms?)` | Compile, simulate, return serial output |
| `wokwi_get_diagram(board)` | Return a minimal `diagram.json` stub to extend |

### Field — diagnosis & auth

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `repair(serial_output, build_id?, board?)` | Send serial/crash output to the diagnosis server and return a structured diagnosis |
| `authenticate(email?, password?)` | Log in to the diagnosis server (direct, or omit both for browser OAuth) |
| `complete_authentication(timeout?)` | Wait for a browser login to finish and store the tokens |
| `auth_status()` / `auth_logout()` / `auth_clear()` / `auth_reconnect(email?, password?)` | Inspect, end, force-clear, or re-establish the authenticated MCP session |

All bench tools fall back to the default device in `~/.nff/config.json` when `port` and `board` are omitted.

> **Prefer `sketch=` (a path) over `code=`.** Write the `.ino` file to disk first and pass the sketch path, rather than raw source — it keeps the build artifact lookup deterministic. Use `compile` to check a build with no board attached; use `flash` only when a port is present.

## Quickstart

Get your hardware on the LLM loop in under five minutes.

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install nff
```

Pure-Python install (requires Python ≥ 3.10) — no compiler or Rust toolchain needed. `esptool` ships as a dependency, so no separate install is needed.

### 2. Install board cores

```bash
# Install the cores you need
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
arduino-cli core install arduino:avr
arduino-cli core install esp8266:esp8266
```

> **arduino-cli** is auto-installed by `nff init` if it is not already on your PATH.

### 3. Plug in your board and run init

```bash
nff init
```

This single command:
- Detects your board by USB vendor/product ID
- Writes `~/.nff/config.json` and a `CLAUDE.md` in the current directory
- Registers the nff MCP server (`claude mcp add nff nff mcp`)
- Installs the `/nff` and `/wokwi-diagram` Claude Code skills globally

```
  ✓ Found: ESP32 (CP210x) on COM10
  ✓ Config written to ~/.nff/config.json
  ✓ CLAUDE.md written to ./CLAUDE.md
  ✓ Claude skills installed: /nff, /wokwi-diagram
  ✓ Registered with Claude Code CLI (claude mcp add nff nff mcp)
  ✓ Claude Desktop config updated
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
nff doctor
```

| `nff init` | Detect board, write config, register MCP server |
| `nff compile <path>` | Compile a sketch to verify it builds (no board/port needed) |
| `nff flash <path>` | Compile and upload a sketch directory |
| `nff monitor` | Stream serial output (Ctrl+C to exit) |
| `nff connect` | Attach to a device, continuously analyse its logs, autonomously repair detected issues |
| `nff repair` | Send captured serial/crash output to the diagnosis server for a structured root-cause |
| `nff auth login` | Authenticate with the diagnosis server (browser OAuth or email/password) |
| `nff doctor` | Check all dependencies and configuration |
| `nff mcp` | Start the MCP server (streamable HTTP on `127.0.0.1:3000`; called automatically by Claude Code) |

```bash
nff flash sketches/sensor_init
nff flash sketches/sensor_init --board esp32:esp32:esp32 --port COM3
nff flash sketches/sensor_init --manual-reset    # for boards without auto-reset
nff monitor --port COM10 --baud 115200
nff monitor --port COM10 --baud 115200 --timeout 15
```

### nff connect — Autonomous log analysis and repair

`nff connect` keeps a live serial connection to your device and routes each batch of output to Claude for analysis. When Claude detects an error, a hang, or a recoverable fault, it rewrites the sketch, recompiles, reflashes, and resumes monitoring — closing the repair loop without manual intervention.

```
nff connect
  ↓ streams serial from device
  ↓ Claude analyses each log window
  ↓ fault detected → sketch rewritten → nff flash → device reset
  ↓ monitoring resumes automatically
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port PORT` | auto-detect | Serial port to attach to |
| `--baud BAUD` | 115200 | Baud rate |
| `--sketch DIR` | last flashed | Sketch directory to rewrite and reflash on a fix |
| `--window MS` | 2000 | Log window passed to Claude per analysis cycle |

## Config File

`~/.nff/config.json`, written by `nff init` and editable by hand:

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "default_device": {
    "port": "COM10",
    "board": "ESP32 (CP210x)",
    "fqbn": "esp32:esp32:esp32",
    "baud": 115200
  },
  "wokwi": {
    "api_token": "YOUR_TOKEN",
    "default_timeout_ms": 5000,
    "diagram_path": null
  }
}
```

The Wokwi token can also be set via `WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN` (takes precedence over config).

---

## Claude Code Skills

nff ships two Claude Code skills **automatically installed to `~/.claude/commands/` by `nff init`**:

| Skill | When to use |
|---|---|
| `/nff` | Full pipeline reference — hardware and simulation workflows, sketch-first rules, debugging checklist |
| `/wokwi-diagram` | `diagram.json` authoring reference — component types, pin names, wiring patterns |

```
/nff
/wokwi-diagram
```

Skill files are bundled inside the package at `nff/nff/skills/` (the source of truth — edit them there) so they ship with every `pip install nff`, and are also mirrored in `.claude/commands/` for project-level use.

The Rust crate under `nff-rs/nff/` is the **shipped binary** and is at full feature parity with the Python package — every CLI command and MCP tool runs natively (no Python runtime). Build it with `cargo build --release` (binary at `nff-rs/target/release/nff`). The Python package under `nff/nff/` is the reference/prototyping implementation and is kept in sync version-for-version; when you add a feature, land it in both so the two never drift.

## Linux: Serial Port Permissions

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
# then log out and back in
```

`nff doctor` detects this and prints the fix.

nff wokwi run --gui        # visual simulation in VS Code
```

Install the [Wokwi VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wokwi.wokwi-vscode) for the animated circuit view.

### Wokwi MCP Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wokwi_flash(code, board?, timeout_ms?)` | Compile and simulate a sketch via Wokwi |
| `wokwi_serial_read(code, board?, duration_ms?)` | Compile, simulate, return serial output |
| `wokwi_get_diagram(board)` | Return a minimal `diagram.json` stub to extend |

### diagram.json — Circuit Schematic

Always include the serial monitor wires:

```json
["esp:TX0", "$serialMonitor:RX", "", []],
["esp:RX0", "$serialMonitor:TX", "", []]
```

Common components:

```json
{ "type": "wokwi-led",        "id": "led1", "attrs": { "color": "red" } }
{ "type": "wokwi-pushbutton", "id": "btn1", "attrs": { "color": "blue" } }
{ "type": "wokwi-servo",      "id": "srv1", "attrs": { "minAngle": "-90", "maxAngle": "90" } }
{ "type": "wokwi-resistor",   "id": "r1",   "attrs": { "value": "220" } }
```

ESP32 DevKit V1 pins: `esp:D<gpio>` · `esp:GND.1` · `esp:GND.2` · `esp:3V3` · `esp:VIN` · `esp:TX0` · `esp:RX0`

Pushbutton wiring: GPIO side → `btn1:1.l`, GND side → `btn1:2.l`. Use `INPUT_PULLUP` in the sketch.

### ESP32 Servo — No Library Required

Use the built-in LEDC peripheral instead of `ESP32Servo`. Wokwi maps its full servo range to 500 µs – 2500 µs pulses.

With 50 Hz / 16-bit resolution (period = 20 000 µs):

| Angle | Pulse | Duty |
|---|---|---|
| −90° (min) | 500 µs | 1638 |
| 0° (center) | 1500 µs | 4915 |
| +90° (max) | 2500 µs | 8192 |

```cpp
ledcAttach(SERVO_PIN, 50, 16);
ledcWrite(SERVO_PIN, 4915);
```

Set `"minAngle": "-90", "maxAngle": "90"` in `diagram.json` for correct visual mapping.
